Mitigation Strategies
Implement Rating Decay: Consider introducing a mechanism where ratings can slightly decrease over time due to inactivity or consistent poor performance, to maintain rating accuracy.
Skill-Level Brackets: Create brackets or leagues to group users with similar skill levels, even within the same rating range.
Regular System Review: Continuously monitor and adjust the rating algorithm to ensure it remains fair and relevant.
Transparency: Clearly communicate how ratings are calculated and what they represent to maintain user trust and understanding.
Prevent Gaming: Implement checks to prevent exploitation of the karma system, like limits on points from referrals or subjective feedback.

Your approach and sequence of steps sound right for setting up a FastAPI application with Google OAuth and a basic frontend. Implementing OAuth should indeed be one of the initial steps, as it's fundamental for user authentication. After that, setting up a basic frontend to interact with your backend, followed by database integration, is a logical progression.

### Implementing Google OAuth in FastAPI
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - You will need `Authlib` for handling the OAuth flow. Install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install 'authlib[asyncio]'
     ```

2. **Setting Up OAuth Routes:**
   - You need to define routes for redirecting to Google's OAuth page and handling the callback.
   - Use the client ID and secret obtained from your GCP OAuth setup.

3. **Storing Credentials Securely:**
   - It's a good practice to store sensitive credentials like your OAuth client ID and secret in environment variables or a configuration file, not directly in your code.

### Basic FastAPI Application with OAuth Routes
Here's an extension to your current FastAPI app to include a basic structure for OAuth:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth
import os

app = FastAPI()

# Set up OAuth
oauth = OAuth()
oauth.register(
    name='google',
    client_id=os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),
    client_secret=os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    access_token_url='https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token',
    access_token_params=None,
    authorize_url='https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth',
    authorize_params=None,
    api_base_url='https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/',
    client_kwargs={'scope': 'openid email profile'}
)

# Redirect to Google's OAuth page
@app.get("/login")
async def login(request: Request):
    redirect_uri = request.url_for('auth')
    return await oauth.google.authorize_redirect(request, redirect_uri)

# OAuth callback route
@app.get("/auth")
async def auth(request: Request):
    try:
        token = await oauth.google.authorize_access_token(request)
        user = await oauth.google.parse_id_token(request, token)
        return {"user": user}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=str(e))

# Your existing routes
@app.get("/test")
def test():
    return {"message": "Hello world!"}

@app.get("/greet/{name}")
def greet(name: str):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}

@app.get("/query-params/")
def query_params(start: int=0, end: int=99):
    return {"start": start, "end": end}
```

### Next Steps
- **Frontend Setup:**
  - Create a basic HTML page with JavaScript to handle the login process and display login status.
  - You can initially use simple forms for username/password input and a button to redirect to Google's OAuth

login.

- **Database Setup:**
  - After OAuth integration, setting up a database is a good next step. This will allow you to store user information, OAuth tokens, and other data necessary for your application.
  - Choose a database that fits your needs (e.g., SQLite for simplicity, PostgreSQL for more robust solutions). Integrate it with FastAPI using ORMs like SQLAlchemy or databases like Tortoise ORM for asynchronous support.

- **Testing OAuth Flow:**
  - Test the OAuth flow to ensure that users can log in through Google and that their data is correctly retrieved and handled by your application.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Ensure that your OAuth implementation is secure. This includes validating tokens, handling user data responsibly, and securing API endpoints.

- **Environment Setup:**
  - Make sure your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set in your environment variables, or use a configuration file to load them securely.

### Summary
Your plan to implement OAuth, set up a basic frontend, and then move on to database integration is a solid approach. Each step builds upon the previous one, allowing you to gradually develop a more complex and functional application.
