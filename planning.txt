Mitigation Strategies
Implement Rating Decay: Consider introducing a mechanism where ratings can slightly decrease over time due to inactivity or consistent poor performance, to maintain rating accuracy.
Skill-Level Brackets: Create brackets or leagues to group users with similar skill levels, even within the same rating range.
Regular System Review: Continuously monitor and adjust the rating algorithm to ensure it remains fair and relevant.
Transparency: Clearly communicate how ratings are calculated and what they represent to maintain user trust and understanding.
Prevent Gaming: Implement checks to prevent exploitation of the karma system, like limits on points from referrals or subjective feedback.
